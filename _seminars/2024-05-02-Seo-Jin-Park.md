**Abstract:**

Granular distributed computing is a new style of computing where an application is split into finer pieces and distributed. It has many potential benefits in resource efficiency and getting more attention. However, the massive number of granules of a single application brings new challenges to use in practice. In this talk, I will present two early-stage ongoing work in debugging and placement optimization.  

**Bio:**

Seo Jin Park has been an Assistant Professor at the USC Computer Science Department since 2023 Fall and co-lead the USC Networked Systems Lab. Before joining USC, he spent a year at Google Systems Research Group. He completed my postdoc at MIT CSAIL with Prof. Mohammad Alizadeh. He received a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2019, where I was advised by Prof. John Ousterhout. His research has been centered on lowering the latencies of networked systems, ranging over in-memory storage, consensus protocol, datacenter overload control, byzantine consensus, etc.
